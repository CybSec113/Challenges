Building out a repository of Python and C++ coding examples.  
This is 100% self-study because I really enjoy solving problems through writing code.  

HackerRank, LeetCode, and Meta directories include solutions to programming "challenges".  

Currently working on adding C++ and java solutions to LeetCode75 problem set.
