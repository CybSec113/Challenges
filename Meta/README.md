# Meta Coding Challenges
## WHAT is this Repo?
This Repo includes Coding Challeges available on Meta's career profile page.  Files that solve challenges are marked with a leading "X".  Commit comments describe current status of unsolved challenges (e.g., 2 of 33 test cases time out, etc.).

While I often Googled language and algorithm references, all the code was written by me.

## WHY is this Repo here?
I am building a Repo to demonstrate coding proficiency.  The end goal is transitioning to a Developer role.
I just started building this repo in April-2024.  This is very much a work in progress.

## WHO's Repo is this?
I am a seasoned Financial Risk Manager with prior experience in Software Development (Linux, C++, SQL).  I am pursuing a career shift into Software Development, hopefully, somewhat related to my prior Risk Management experience.

In May, 2024, I expect to graduate from NYU's Tandon School of Engineering as a Cyber Fellow (85% merit scholarship) with a Master of Science degree in Cybersecurity (Comp. Sci. track).  GPA: 3.8

I also have undergraduate degrees in Computer Science, Business Administration, and an MBA with a concentration in Financial Engineering.

## HOW to execute these solutions
These solutions are currently written for Python3 interpreter (3.12.2).  Make sure you have the dependent imported modules.  Files will typically have a single defined function and a main.  The "Solution" includes only the code in the function body, not the main function.  The main function includes a few test cases that can be alternated.
